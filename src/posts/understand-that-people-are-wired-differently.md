üßë‚Äç‚úàÔ∏è Captain Obvious thought - It's a super power to have some level of understanding that people are wired differently and then acting on that.

So much heartache in my work life went away when I internalized this fact and learned to adjust my approach based on how people I'm interacting with seem to be wired.

Again, this is obvious to many. But, so much frustration I observe in the day to day is at least in part due to people not understanding how someone else thinks, processes, or communicates differently than they do.

All models are wrong, but I've found DISC and enneagram to be most useful for me as ways of trying to classify myself and others.
