My favorite, most empowered digital product team I've ever worked on:

- Knew the job of the engineers was more than just shipping code and closing "tickets"

- Had everyone on the team participate in or directly observe discovery work

- Shipped something to production one or more times most days

- Had helpful and not overbearing automated testing

- Was made up of thoughtful people putting ongoing effort into improving our ways of working together

That team still dissolved because we had the wrong _strategy_ that led us to a dead end.

I'm spending a lot of time thinking through how to communicate what great looks like so I can empower others to remove some of the obstacles to getting to the highest level and _sustaining_ it.

What are some other qualities of the best team(s) you've ever worked on?
