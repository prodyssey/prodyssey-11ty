It's baseball season, and product development is kind of like baseball. Even the best individual contributors in the world don't get a hit every time up to the plate.

A whole lot of folks spend all their time imagining they're Robert Redford at the end of "The Natural."

They should be thinking about maximizing their chances of getting runners on base and creating more at-bats. Moneyball.

To steal a Bezos line, in this business you can score 1,000 runs in a single swing.

But you're more likely to be successful if you're not trying to do that for every pitch - pick your spots to swing away. Bunt or take a walk once in a while.

Ok, I'm done stretching the analogy. Pass the Cracker Jack. üçø
