Most people think software product development works like a factory. The much better metaphor is a family farm.

There are lots of techniques from manufacturing that are useful, some more widely used than others. Kanban, lean principles, small batches, etc.

But, when making a software product, the results don't tend to roll off the line and into a truck to get shipped elsewhere.

The things we make become part of an ecosystem that has to be carefully maintained and cared for, or it will start to degrade over time.

There are seasons where different types of work are important.

Sometimes parts of the ecosystem have to be worked on in a different way to pave the way for future success.

How might you plan and work differently if you switch from thinking about the work as widgets to crank and start thinking about reaping what you sow?

h/t to John Cutler for being the first person to introduce me to this mental model
