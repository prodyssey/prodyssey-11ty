I'm having a blast every day using a tool called "GodMode" to talk to multiple LLM chatbots at the same time - hat tip to Anthony Panozzo for the recommendation on one of my previous posts.

It's a game changer for me as mostly a generalist to be able to mix and match the best bits of answers to help me go deeper, to solve more problems on my own, and better work with specialists.
