Zulily CTO Courtney Kissler brilliantly articulates something I've come to feel very deeply:

Optimizing for _speed of deployment_ often drives the benefits digital product companies try to optimize for like cost, and efficiency.

I would even add product value to the mix.

If you're not able to sustainably and safely deploy to production daily if you want to, that's probably the highest impact thing for you to figure out how to prioritize. Yes, even over what you think is your next killer feature.

Once you have the systems in place the momentum builds fast.

Without it, it's _really_ easy to get bogged down.
