What if you could generate reports out of your Jira data that helped everyone regardless of function understand what's _really_ happening in SaaS product development in human understandable terms?

Not dehumanizing "productivity" metrics per se, but a team first understanding of where the time and talent of the team are going.

This is one of the most impactful tools in my bag for my fractional work. Most of the time, the results surprise the team and the leaders of other functions.

It helps product development teams:

- Build trust
- Plan more effectively
- See whether what they're trying to plan towards is working or not

I'm testing a smaller, packaged service offering for SaaS product teams vs. my typical bespoke fractional engagements and I am looking for people interested in early access and providing feedback.

Early access criteria:

- Use Jira
- Make a B2B SaaS product
- 1 Million+ ARR, 2 years+ since launch
- Able to spend 2-4 hour-ish sessions over the course of a month or so to dial in the data and provide feedback

Is this you? Send me a message and let's ðŸ¤“ out together.
