Cursor is WAY better than GitHub copilot right now.

I know I'm not the first person to rave about this particular product, but after spending meaningful time writing code with it over the last couple of weeks, it feels like another level up beyond what copilot was.

The ability to bring an entire small to medium codebase into context for generating new files gives me the "claude artifacts, but right in the IDE" killer app experience I was hoping was out there after having a lot of fun with those.

It is also much smarter so far in my experience at guessing what I'm trying to do and autocompleting it.

I don't know if it's defensible for them as a business long term vs. GitHub and the field, but I appreciate them pushing the envelope.

I normally resist futzing with new tools, but this is a big enough leap to make it worth it in my opinion.
