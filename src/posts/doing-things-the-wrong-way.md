It's possible to do almost everything the "wrong" way and still make a product that succeeds.

It took me a long time to come to terms with that. If I'm honest, maybe I still haven't all the way.

I'm someone who has gotten really excited about various "right" ways to do things over the years.

The reality is nobody does everything right. There isn't any one right way to build product. There are lots of giant shoulders to stand on, but this is not a solved problem.

If you're not working in a pure startup, your company survived and maybe even thrived without doing things the way you might think they should be done.

It's important to remember that when you're trying to change to new ways of doing things. Inertia is hard.

Everything your company invests in is still a bet, even if you're following all the best practices.

Great bets still lose a lot of the time - but over time they win more often.

Don't give up. But, remember it's unwise to burn _all_ the trust you've built trying to change the way things are done wholesale.

It still might not lead to automatic success. Think incrementally.

Good luck. We all need it to win. That, some hard work, and some good timing.
