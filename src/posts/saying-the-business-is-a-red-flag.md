If members of your team regularly use the label "the business" and you make a digital product that gets sold to customers, you have a mindset problem.

"The business wants X" is something that comes from one of two places:

1. An IT mindset where the team is a cost center and is building back office technology to support the true value stream of the company

2. A contract development mindset where the point is to build something to a defined spec.

When you help make a digital product, you ARE "the business" just as much as anyone else. The team is a profit center.

Whether everyone realizes it or not, everyone on the team has a hand in discovering and understanding what it is that customers value in a way that works for your business, and then delivering that.
