Realistic product planning starts with a solid understanding of where the team's time actually went previously. "Be a goldfish" is great advice for athletes and performers. It's a disaster for people who build software products.

Making sure it's easy to review where your time went in human digestible ways makes this a lot easier. That and reviewing what the impact was of what you released over time are critical inputs to planning how you spend your next cycle, your next quarter, or your whole roadmap.
