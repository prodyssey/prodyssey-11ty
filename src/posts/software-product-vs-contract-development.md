Good software product development is so different from traditional good development of a contracted software project.

It seems to me so much angst in product development comes from people trying to apply best practices from contract development to software products.

The goal is not to satisfy the specifications of the contract.

The goal is to deliver sustainable, marketable, sellable value that in many, many scenarios can't be specified effectively up front.

It has to be co-discovered with customers.
