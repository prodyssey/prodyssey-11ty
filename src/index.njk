      <p class="text-l font-serif leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Most SaaS companies start out with one thing in mind: growth.
      </p>
      <p class="text-l font-serif leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
        They start with a small product based on a few key insights, raise
        capital, and execute like crazy to grow the top line. There's probably
        at least a pivot or two in there. The cash burns.
      </p>
      <p class="text-l font-serif leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
        It's a long, difficult, and dangerous journey. Most crash out and shut
        down early. Maybe they get acqui-hired.
      </p>
      <p class="text-l font-serif leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
        A very small number of companies make it to true escape velocity. They
        make fortunes for the founders and early employees. They get the glowing
        profiles. They return the fund.
      </p>
      <p class="text-l font-serif leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
        In between those extremes, there are companies that started out like the
        rest, and haven't crashed. They found and fostered good traction.
      </p>
      <p class="text-l font-serif leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
        But, they haven't reached the stars.
      </p>
      <p class="text-l font-serif leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
        They have built a good business with somewhere between ~5 to 75 million
        in ARR. But they've hit a plateau or are about to.
      </p>
      <p class="text-l font-serif leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
        They've probably got a lot of technical debt and product baggage that's
        making it hard to deliver the roadmap. They're struggling to take
        advantage of their data, and want to figure out how to use AI to their
        advantage. They're almost certainly having a hard time enabling their
        growth functions.
      </p>
      <p class="text-l font-serif leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
        It's time to take a different approach - one focused on growing
        profitably and becoming "default alive."
      </p>
      <p class="text-l font-serif leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
        It's a path that maximizes both optionality and enterprise value for a
        different but still good outcome. It opens up the possibility of great
        returns on capital and employee sweat over the long haul.
      </p>
      <p class="text-l font-serif leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
        It's a hard transition.
      </p>
      <p class="text-l font-serif leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
        I've been there. I learned how to do it the hard way, and now I use the
        framework I've built to help others navigate that journey.
