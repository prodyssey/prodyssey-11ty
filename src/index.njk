        You've been a key part of building a really good SaaS business.
      </p>
      <p class="text-l font-serif leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
        It's clear now you're not on the type of rocketship ride most people think of when they think "tech startup".
      </p>
      <p class="text-l font-serif leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
        But, you're not going to burn through all your cash and shut down. You're not going to get picked up for song. That's what happens to most of them. Not your team.
      </p>
      <p class="text-l font-serif leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Even though it probably wasn't the original dream, you can still make your good business a <i>really</i> good one with an outcome to match when the timing is right.
      </p>
      <p class="text-l font-serif leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
        It's even possible for it not to be a total slog along the way.
      </p>
      <p class="text-l font-serif leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Especially if you get the right help.

        You've grown to somewhere between ~5 to 75 million
        in ARR. But you've hit a plateau or you can see one coming if something doesn't change.
      </p>
      <p class="text-l font-serif leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
        You've probably been in a lot of conversations about technical debt and have product baggage that's
        making it hard to deliver the roadmap.
      </p>
      <p class="text-l font-serif leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
        It's harder than it seems like it should be to make use of the data you've got locked away in your infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p class="text-l font-serif leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
        The AI wave seems like it can help you, but it's hard to tell what's real and what's a waste of time.
      </p>
      <p class="text-l font-serif leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Your growth and retention functions are frustrated and aren't getting enough of the enablement they need to be great.
      </p>
      <p class="text-l font-serif leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Your product and technical functions are capable and working hard but struggling to stay above water. They're also frustrated and probably burning out.
      </p>
      <p class="text-l font-serif leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
        It's time for a different approach - one focused on growing
        profitably and sustainably. It's time to restart the momentum on a new path.
      </p>
      <p class="text-l font-serif leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
        It's a hard transition.
      </p>
      <p class="text-l font-serif leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
        I've been there. I learned how to do it the hard way, and now I use the
        framework I've built to help others navigate that journey.
