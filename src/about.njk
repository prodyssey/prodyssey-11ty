        You're a key part of building a good SaaS business. It's grown to somewhere between ~5 and 75 million in ARR.

        But, you're not going to burn through all your cash and shut down. You're not going to get scrapped for parts. That's what happens to most of them.

        You can still make your business a <i>really</i> good one with an outcome to match when the timing is right.
      </p>
                    <p class="text-l font-serif leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
        It can even be a lot of fun and not a slog along the way.

        Good businesses like this have hard problems to solve:

        Maybe you've hit a growth plateau. If not, you can see one coming if something big doesn't change.

        Technical debt and big proposed investments to fix it are a recurring theme.

        Product baggage is making the roadmap feel like a wish list instead of a predictable plan.

        You know the AI wave can help you, but it's hard to tell what's real and what's a waste of time.

        It's a brutal transition. I've been there.

        I learned how to do it the hard way, and now I use the framework I've built to help others navigate that journey.
