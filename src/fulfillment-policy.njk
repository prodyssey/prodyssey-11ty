            <h2 class="text-2xl font-serif font-bold text-secondary mb-4 mt-8">Service Delivery</h2>
            <p class="text-l font-serif leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
                All services provided by Prodyssey are governed by individual Master Service Agreements (MSAs) and Statements of Work (SOWs) that are executed between Prodyssey and each client. These agreements detail the specific services to be provided, timelines, deliverables, and payment terms.
            </p>
            <p class="text-l font-serif leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Services are typically delivered according to the schedule outlined in the applicable SOW, with regular check-ins and progress updates provided to clients throughout the engagement.
            </p>
