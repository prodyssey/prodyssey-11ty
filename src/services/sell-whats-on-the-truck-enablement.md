It's a common way SaaS companies grow: identify a key target customer, and then agree to build whatever they need to get them to buy.

This can be a huge growth lever, but it can also kill the company if it gets overused.

If this is becoming a crutch for new sales, it's likely the team doesn't have a great grasp on what the existing product capabilities can effectively do.

This is a product marketing + enablement problem.

We can help. We've enabled sales teams on incredibly complex products, helping distill down capabilities into relatable stories that they can take and make their own on their way to closing new business.
