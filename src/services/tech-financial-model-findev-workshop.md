SaaS companies often struggle to predict infrastructure costs, especially when developing on top of cloud providers.

At the same time, finance folks and technical operations folks speak different languages.

That way, you can predict how growth will impact your infrastructure spend so you can make sure you aren't losing out on profitability.
