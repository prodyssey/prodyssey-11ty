You would benefit from having a seasoned, multi product portfolio leader on your team, but it doesn't make sense to make the commitment to a full-time CPO.

Maybe you're looking at an acquisition and need help evaluating the multi product portfolio strategy but don't have that expertise in house and shouldn't hire it without actually closing the deal.

Maybe you have what you need on the team but could use a more experienced outside perspective on a regular but not daily basis.

We have lots of experience in providing big product leadership impact in small time blocks.
