Many technical folks who have never tried to rebuild a revenue producing product from scratch think the solution to "technical debt" is to start over. It has to be easier than fixing what's broken, right?

This is almost always a critical, potentially company killing mistake.

If you are willing to spend 3x the amount of estimated time and cost - go ahead.

Otherwise, it's much wiser to figure out how to evolve.

We've been part of many platform rebuild failures and successful evolutions, and know how to guide your team through this type of difficult transition without grinding progress to a halt.
