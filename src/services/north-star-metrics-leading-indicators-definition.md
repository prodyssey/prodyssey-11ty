Most companies measure success based on the balance sheet.

The problem is, those are lagging indicators. They're mostly driven by what you were doing months or even years ago.

Leading indicators properly defined and tracked let you see how you're doing today, and predict how you'll do tomorrow.

We will work with your team to identify the "North Star" metrics that will drive your product to profitable growth.

Then you can instrument and track those metrics to drive your decisions in the company from the exec team to the line level contributors.
