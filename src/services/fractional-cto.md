You would benefit from having a seasoned technology leader on your team, but it doesn't make sense to make the commitment to a full-time CTO.

Maybe you need a partner to help you evaluate a strategic technical path forward before making the big swing on a big hire.

Maybe you have what you need on the team but could use an outside perspective on a regular but not daily basis.

We have deep experience in providing big impact in small time blocks.
